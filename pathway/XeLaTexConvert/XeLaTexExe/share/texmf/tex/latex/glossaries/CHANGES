glossaries change log:

v3.01:

   * made commands like \glslink, \gls and \acrshort robust

   * Fixed bugs in commands like \acrfullpl which was missing the
     plural in some cases.

   * Removed \acronymfont from \acrfullformat as it's already used
     in the second argument passed to that command. (Causes a 
     problem with the "smaller" option.)

v3.0 (Major changes):

   * Documentation has been restructured:

     - glossaries-user: main user manual
     - glossariesbegin: cut-down introduction for beginners
     - mfirstuc-manual: user manual for mfirstuc package
     - glossaries.pdf: documented code for advanced users
     - glossary2glossaries: upgrading from glossary.sty to glossaries.sty

   * Added new package options:

     - entrycounter : number main (level 0) entries in the glossary.

     - counterwithin : set parent counter for the entry counter.

     - subentrycounter : number level 1 entries in the glossary.

     - sort : set the sort order to 
              - standard alphabetical (sort=standard),
              - order of definition (sort=def) 
              - order of use (sort=use)

     - seeautonumberlist : automatically activates the number list
                           for entries that use the "see" key.

     - savewrites : minimise number of \newwrite

     - compatible-2.07 :

         bug fixes in v3.0 have cause compatibility problems. This 
         package option will restore the old behaviour but bugs will 
         remain.  (Should mostly only effect documents that used
         \noist with a custom Xindy style file.)

   * \printglossary sets \currentglossary to the current glossary's
     label. (Allows custom glossary styles access to the glossary
     type.)

   * Modified internal workings of acronyms and:

     - Added starred versions of \acrshort etc.

     - Added "long", "short", "longplural" and "shortplural" keys
       (Reserved for use with \newacronym.)

     - Added analogous "longaccess", "shortaccess", "longpluralaccess"
       and "shortpluralaccess" keys for \newacronym in 
       glossaries-accsupp.sty

   * Added \glsseeitemformat to customise the text given in the link
     created by \glsseeitem.

   * \newglossaryentry key "nonumberlist" now boolean.

   * added debugging commands \showgloname etc.

   * now loads etoolbox:

     - replaced \DeclareRobustCommand with \newrobustcmd

     - replaced \@ifundefined with \ifcsundef

     - replaced \let...\undefined with \undef...

   * Bug Fixes:

     - now works with equation counter in amsmath's align
       environment.

     - Mixed counters now work with xindy option.

     - Fixed hyperlinks in location numbers where \theH<counter>
       has a prefix not present in \the<counter>.

     - If title specified in \printglossary but toctitle hasn't
       been specified, make toctitle same as supplied title.

     - \newglossaryentry "see" key and \glssee now sanitize and escape 
       special characters before writing to output file. (Allows
       user to redefine \seename any point before \printglossary or
       \printglossaries.)

     - \glshyperlink: Changed the default value of the optional argument
                      to \glsentrytext instead of \glsentryname.

     path, then the translator package will now be automatically 
     loaded.

     object in the group is converted to uppercase. Examples:

     \makefirstuc{abc}        -> Abc
     \makefirstuc{\emph{abc}} -> \emph{Abc}
     \makefirstuc{{\'a}bc}    -> {\'A}bc
     \makefirstuc{\ae bc}     -> \AE bc
     \makefirstuc{{\ae}bc}    -> {\AE}bc

     (but don't do \makefirstuc{\ae{}bc} which produces \ae Bc.)

v1.11 (2 March 2008):
