                 publishing and computer science has already been

                 Further connections between the two fields are
                 highlighted in this brief paper and it is suggested
                 that electronic publishing differs from other computer
                 application areas because it benefits not only from the
                 brute-force application of cheap computer power but
                 also from the direct application of a host of computer
                 science concepts. The history of computers and
                 typesetters is examined leading up to the electronic
                 publishing era, followed by an appraisal of those
                 computer science topics which have already been applied
                 to problems in typesetting and publishing, and those
                 which seem poised for exploitation and application in
                 the near future. The importance of abstract notions and
                 high-level ideas in the development of computer
                 science---and hence in electronic publishing---is
                 pointed out.",

                  manual.  The input consists of lines containing
                  index terms and page numbers.  The programs collect
                  multiple occurrences of the same terms, compress
                  runs of page numbers, create permutations (e.g.,
                  `index, book' from `book index'), and sort them into
                  proper alphabetic order.  The programs can cope with
                  embedded formatting commands (size and font changes,
                  etc.), with roman numeral page numbers, and with
                  {\bf see} terms.  The programs do not help with the
                  original creation of index terms.

                  The implementation runs on the UNIX\registered{}
                  operating system.  It uses a long pipeline of short
                  {\bf awk} programs rather than a single program in a
                  conventional language.  This structure makes the
                  programs easy to adapt or augment to meet special
                  requirements that arise in different indexing
                  styles.  The programs were intended to be used with
                  {\bf troff}, but can be used with a formatter like
                  {\TeX} with minor changes.

                  Document preparation systems that are oriented to an
                  author's preparation of printed material must permit
                  the flexible specification, modification, and reuse of
                  the contents of the document.  Interactive document
                  preparation systems commonly have incorporated simple
                  representations---an unconstrained linear list of
                  document objects in the `What You See Is What You Get'
                  (\WYSIWYG) systems.  Recent research projects have
                  been directed at the interactive manipulation of
                  richer tree-oriented representations in which object
                  relationships are constrained through grammatical
                  specification.  The advantage of such representations
                  is the increased flexibility that they provide in the
                  reusability of the document and its components and the
                  more powerful user commands that they permit.  We
                  report on the experience gained from the design of two
                  such systems.  Although the two systems were designed
                  independently of each other, a common set of issues,
                  representations, and techniques has been identified.
                  An important component of these projects has been to
                  examine the {\WYSIWYG} user interface, retaining the
                  naturalness of their user interface but eliminating
                  their dependencies on the physical-page
                  representation.  Aspects of the design of such systems
                  remain open for further research.  We describe these
                  open research problems and indicate some of the

                  called `electronic publishing' would perhaps be
                  better called `electronic printing' or `electronic
                  typography' or `electronic drawing' or `electronic
                  file cabinets'. The word `publishing' has
                  traditionally meant `to make generally known' or `to
                  disseminate'.  In December 1985 I began a venture in
                  true electronic publishing\emdash{}`true' in the sense
                  that its primary goals were to explore electronic
                  dissemination rather than electronic typesetting or
                  formatting. I wanted to start a periodical that
                  could be distributed electronically, that would use
                  computers for every aspect of its production and
                  distribution process, and that would be on a topic
                  of wide enough interest to attract subscribers in as
                  many countries as possible. Furthermore the topic
                  had to be absorbing enough to engage my own interest
                  for long enough to gain substantial experience.

                  The chosen topic was cookery. I began a weekly
                  magazine whose contents are recipes.  To submit a
                  recipe for publication, a prospective author mails
                  the recipe to the editor by electronic mail. The
                  publishing process from that point is similar to
                  more ordinary magazines. A copy editor rewrites the
                  recipe for stylistic consistency and then hands it
                  to the `international desk', which checks to make
                  sure that the recipe uses only ingredients that are
                  widely known and internationally available. The
                  international desk also converts recipes to or from
                  metric units, so that every recipe will include
                  both. From the international desk, the recipe goes
                  to a `test and proofreading' office, at which an
                  editor checks to make sure that the recipe is
                  coherent and comprehensible and that the dish it
                  describes is palatable.  Finally, recipes are moved
                  to the production office, where they are bundled
                  into issues in time to meet a Thursday publication
                  deadline. During this test period I have done all of
                  the editorial tasks myself, but the internal
                  structure of the publication system is such that
                  different people could do the different tasks
                  without disrupting the flows and procedures.

                  The recipes are distributed in a text formatting
                  language, and each subscriber is sent software to
                  format that language into some output format that he
                  can print on his machine. Subscribers typically
                  extract the recipes out of each weekly issue and put
                  them into a local database, from which they can
                  print pages for a notebook or access the recipes
                  with online retrieval commands. The text formatting
                  language is a dialect of {\em troff}, and the vast
                  majority of subscribers use a special set of {\em
                  troff\/} macros to do the formatting.  The publication
                  is called {\em The USENET Cookbook}. It has about
                  13~000 subscribers worldwide, and has had recipes
                  contributed by about 300 different people. Most of
                  the subscribers are in English-speaking countries.",

                  computer provides opportunities for the exploitation
                  of parallel processing. It is straightforward to
                  identify blocks of material such as complete diagrams
                  or paragraphs of text which can be processed in
                  parallel and which have modest requirements for
                  synchronization and communication between the blocks.
                  The features of a problem which lead to an elegant and
                  efficient application of parallelism are identified,
                  including good locality of reference, a small `state
                  vector' of shared global variables and a clear
                  relationship between the material on the page and the
                  `cost' of processing it.  This last-named attribute
                  enables a problem to be partitioned among multiple
                  processors by a static compile-time analysis rather
                  than relying on costly run-time allocation strategies.
                  The {\PIC} program for line diagrams has been modified
                  to allow for such a static allocation and to permit
                  synchronization and rendezvous between multiple
                  invocations of the program.  The aim of this was to
                  investigate whether worthwhile gains in performance
                  would result from subdividing a diagram drawn with
                  {\PIC} and then processing the various portions in
                  parallel.  A series of benchmark timings is presented
                  which show the degree of overlap obtainable in
                  processing separate parts of a diagram together with
                  the inherent limits to parallelism imposed by the
                  `atomic' entities in {\PIC} and the inevitable
                  communication overheads between the parallel
                  processes.  The design features of the {\PIC} language
                  are identified which made it suitable for these
                  researches and we are able to draw certain general
                  conclusions about desirable properties of text and
                  graphic entities which are to be processed in
                  parallel. This in turn enables us to identify design
                  features of the underlying software which will

                  is printed in its own correct direction, but for
                  which a human cognizant of the reading conventions
                  will reproduce the input order.  The system

                  will be organized differently from research papers --
                  and at a lower level as a result of the layout
                  conventions by which the text is formatted.  These
                  structuring regimes may be seen as defining a set of
                  constraints which a document within a specific class
                  must satisfy.  In this paper we examine the model
                  recently proposed in Reference \cite{Koo} which is
                  used for representing and modifying electronic
                  documents. This employs simple graph grammars as a
                  means of translating changes in the document structure
                  into modifications to the computer representation.
                  The aim of this approach is to provide computer
                  support which will allow the appropriate structural
                  conventions to be preserved while the document is
                  being edited. We consider the following problem with
                  this method: given a set of `constraints' which the
                  document must satisfy and a collection of rules
                  prescribing how the document representation may be
                  modified, how does one prove that {\em only\/}
                  documents which obey the constraints can be generated
                  by repeated applications of the rules? We describe one
                  way in which this question can be more precisely
                  formulated and call this the {\em consistency
                  checking\/} problem. It is shown that, in general,
                  this problem cannot be solved. We then outline how,

                  The work presented here concerns a document processing
                  model accounting for aspects of an activity which is
                  usually called formatting. The core of the model, an
                  experimental formatting language called FFL, is the
                  central topic.

                  FFL is a purely functional language in the style of FP
                  and the applicative part of APL\@. Sequences,
                  characters, and so-called boxes constitute the data
                  types and among the build-in primitives are functions
                  for aligning/spacing, breaking etc. Emphasis is put on
                  presenting the language and exemplifying its use.

                  Also considered are issues in type checking of
                  formatting function definitions and techniques for
                  doing incremental formatting with FFL formatting
                  functions.

                  editing session, emphasizing how the system's
                  document model and user interface help support the
                  creation of large documents.

                  Although we feel that IGD successfully addressed
                  some of the issues of scale, experience with the
                  system has convinced us that it is wrong to cast
                  many of the problems of authoring large hypertexts
                  as ones that can be solved by implementing editors
                  of sufficient scope and sophistication.  We believe
                  that hypertext design systems based on direct

                  approach to document design and layout, exemplified
                  by IGD, with the promise of a knowledge-based,
                  automated alternative, and discuss why we feel that
                  many of the facilities provided by IGD will still be

                  ISO Standard that specifies a language for document
                  representation.  The main idea behind SGML is to
                  strictly separate the structure and contents of a
                  document from the processing of that document.  This
                  results in application-independent and thus reusable
                  documents.  To gain the full benefit of this
                  approach, tools are needed to support a wide range
                  of applications.  The Standard itself does not
                  define how to specify the processing of documents.
                  Many existing SGML systems allow for a simple
                  translation of an SGML document, which exhibits a
                  1--1 correspondence between elements in the SGML
                  document and its translation.  For many applications
                  this does not suffice.  In other systems the
                  processing can be expressed in a special-purpose
                  programming language.  In this paper the various
                  approaches to processing SGML documents are

                  processing actions are embedded in the grammar rules
                  that specify the document structure, much like
                  processing actions are embedded in grammars of
                  programming languages that are input to a parser
                  generator.  The appendix contains an extended

                  rather than their appearance.  Nevertheless most of
                  the popular document processing systems concentrate
                  on appearance rather than structure, mainly because
                  most users opt for a user interface that is
                  interactive, simple and direct.

                  This paper considers issues related to fonts and
                  other appearance attributes within hypertext
                  documents.  It first presents the relevant
                  differences between hypertext systems and document
                  preparation systems whose end product is paper.  It
                  then goes on to describe a scheme for representing
                  appearance through logical structure.  The scheme
                  aims to meet the extra needs of hypertext systems,
                  and yet still to be simple enough to attract wide

                  hand-digitizing, auto-tracing and direct design on a

                  scaling requires us to ensure the `optical' quality
                  of a font and also the `numerical' quality of its

                  to be added to the font production process.
                  Furthermore, a given typeface has to be rendered on
                  a wide variety of output devices ranging from
                  computer displays, printers (dot-matrix, laser,

                  two-stage retrieval algorithm in which an initial
                  text-signature search is used to exclude large
                  numbers of documents from the detailed and
                  time-consuming pattern-matching search. The latter
                  is implemented using a processor farm, so that

                  interdisciplinary nature of the subject.

                  A course on the theory of electronic publishing
                  given to typography students is used as an example
                  of the type of material that might be covered and
                  how it may be structured. A HyperCard has been
                  developed alongside part of this course. The way in
                  which this subject fits in with the course in
                  Typography \& Graphic Communication as a whole is
                  briefly described.

                  It is proposed that hypertext systems go some way
                  towards providing students with alternative
                  structures for organizing their knowledge of
                  electronic publishing. This platform could therefore
                  be used as the basis for a core curriculum from
                  which various material is developed and structures
                  created.",

                  documentation. The main goal of {\bf ALIVE} is to
                  enable the user of a technical publishing system to
                  establish live-links with data stored on remote
                  databases. Live-links allow for automatic update of
                  a document with database contents: whenever a
                  modification occurs in the database data referenced
                  from the document text, the document is updated
                  accordingly.

                  The {\bf ALIVE} user interface has been implemented
                  by exploiting the functionality offered by the
                  Interleaf\registered{} technical publishing

                  to formulate queries related to data stored in them
                  by means of a menu-based interface.

                  By enriching technical publishing features with data
                  consistency controls in a uniform way, {\bf ALIVE}

                  that is able for format multilingual scientific
                  documents, containing text in Arabic or Persian, as
                  well as other languages, plus pictures, graphs,
                  formulae, tables, bibliographical citations, and
                  bibliographies.  The system is an extension of {\tt
                  ditroff/ffortid} that is already capable of handling
                  Hebrew in the context of multilingual scientific
                  documents.  {\tt ditroff/ffortid} itself is a
                  collection of pre- and postprocessors for the UNIX
                  {\tt ditroff} (Device Independent Typesetter RunOFF)
                  formatter.  The new system is built without changing
                  {\tt ditroff} itself.  The extension consists of a
                  new preprocessor, fonts, and a modified existing
                  postprocessor.

                  The preprocessor transliterates from a phonetic
                  rendition of Arabic using only the two cases of the
                  Latin alphabet.  The preprocessor assigns a
                  position, stand-alone, connected-previous,
                  connected-after, or connected-both, to each letter.
                  It recognizes ligatures and assigns vertical
                  positions from a standard Arabic keyboard using the
                  standard ASMO encoding.  In any case, the output has
                  each positioned letter or ligature and each
                  diacritical mark encoded according to the font's
                  encoding scheme.

                  The fonts are assumed to be designed to connect
                  letters that should be connected when they are
                  printed adjacent to each other.

                  The postprocessor is an enhancement of the {\tt
                  ffortid} program that arranges for right-to-left
                  printing of identified right-to-left fonts.  The
                  major enhancement is stretching final letters of
                  lines or words instead of inserting extra inter-word
                  spaces, in order to justify the text.

                  As a self-test, this paper was formatted using the
                  described system, and it contains many examples of
                  text written in Arabic, Hebrew, and English.",

                  means of communication, starting with hand-set metal
                  type and mechanical typesetting in hot metal.
                  Present-day techniques of phototypesetting, and of
                  digital typesetting, via cathode-ray tube and laser
                  machines, are also discussed. Careful attention is
                  paid to the cultural impact of these techniques,
                  with particular reference to traditional French
                  typefaces which often have small x-height and very
                  thin hairlines (which can disappear at small point
                  sizes). Reference is also made to the impact of each
                  of these modern typesetting methods on both
                  `informational' and `cultural' texts.

                  A strong argument is presented that a nation's
                  typefaces encapsulate its national spirit and its
                  culture. For this reason, it is regrettable that the
                  advent of laser-driven imaging devices has brought
                  with it an `anglicization' of many fonts, via an
                  increase in x-height, and a reluctance to
                  countenance a non-linear variation of letterforms
                  and set-width with point size \emdash{} a
                  characteristic so crucial to the readability of
                  classic texts. A plea is made for the rapidly
                  developing computer technology to be deployed in the
                  interests of {\em quality\/} as well as
                  {\em quantity}. Modern techniques have all the
                  advantages of photographic sharpness but this must
                  be harnessed to the traditional subtleties of the
                  original typeface design if the intentions, and the
                  cultural identity, of the typeface designer are to

                  types, including text, graphics, animations, and
                  digitized sound and images.  Effective database
                  support for hypermedia-based computing environments
                  is essential.  In order to be effective, this
                  support must provide a variety of capabilities that
                  are not offered by the current generation of
                  database management systems.  We report on a
                  prototypic system called HB1 that has been designed
                  to meet the storage needs of advanced hypermedia
                  system architectures.  HB1 is referred to as a
                  hyperbase management system (HBMS) because it stores
                  and manipulates information and the connectivity
                  data that link information together to form
                  hypermedia.

                  HB1 is composed of three subsystems: the Object
                  Manager (OM), Association Set Manager (ASM), and
                  Storage Manager (SM).  OM and ASM are both server
                  processes accessible to distributed client processes
                  via IPC interfaces.  OM is an object server.  ASM
                  manages structural data applicable to the objects
                  within OM's repository that are involved in
                  hypermedia connections.  Physical storage is managed
                  by SM which, in this implementation, is a semantic
                  network database management system.  HB1
                  instantiates a conceptual model of hypermedia that
                  is distinctly computational, has a strong notion of
                  anchor and link, and abstracts information,
                  behavior, and structure from hypermedia.  It has
                  been used as a back-end for an open, object-based
                  hypermedia system that implements distributed,
                  inter-application linking.  HB1 is proving to be an

                  they are still not very common in the east Asian
                  countries where Chinese characters are used. The
                  reason for this is that the complex, structured
                  shapes of Chinese characters take a long time to
                  design and develop.

                  Several systems have proposed automatic generation
                  of outline fonts from the original master
                  fonts. These systems have the serious problem of
                  quality degradation when rasterizing the font at
                  small point sizes, because they do not incorporate a
                  hinting mechanism to adjust the outlines under these
                  circumstances.

                  In this paper, we present an experimental study on a
                  hinting mechanism specially designed for
                  Chinese-style characters. We propose a scheme which
                  automatically generates the hinted outline data from
                  the plain outline fonts.

                  We have implemented and experimented with four sets
                  of Korean Myungjo (Ming) and Gothic style fonts, and
                  have obtained good results with respect to font

                  the hyperdocument.  Canto uses two types of nodes:
                  concept nodes, which provide organizational
                  structure, and information nodes, which contain text
                  and other data.  The operations provided by the

                  Darmstadt, Germany, from 11 to 13 April
                  1994. Earlier conferences in the series took place
                  in 1989 at Lausanne, Switzerland (organized by Roger
                  D. Hersch, EPFL) and in 1991 at Boston,
                  Massachussets (organized by Robert A. Morris,
                  University of Massachussets at Boston). The
                  corresponding proceedings are published by Cambridge
                  University Press (see below).

                  Digital typography is a relatively new field: the
                  first commercial cathode-ray-tube photo\-composing
                  machine appeared in 1966. Since that time, the field
                  has been growing very fast, and is still
                  active. During the RIDT'89 conference, emphasis was
                  laid on the rasterisation of outline characters and
                  on rendering techniques. RIDT'91 concentrated more
                  on digital halftoning and on greyscale
                  characters. However, both of these conferences bore
                  in mind that beyond the mathematics of shapes and
                  their rendering, printing types exist with their own
                  aesthetic rules. That is why the presentations were
                  made by a mix of technologists, scientists and
                  designers.

                  The RIDT'94 programme committee tried to attract a
                  similar mix of papers when this conference was
                  launched. As expected, the fields have moved on
                  since the last conference, but we hope that the
                  selected papers adequately exhibit the present state
                  of the art in raster imaging and digital typography.

                  In the recent past, formal research in digital
                  typography has dealt with graphical algorithms, such
                  as the rendering of outline characters and the
                  generation of outline characters from bit-mapped
                  drawings, to name but two.  Present research focuses
                  on models and methods for concise but precise font
                  description and modelling. That trend began in
                  industry with font interpolation programs and font
                  systems such as Adobe Systems' Multiple Master
                  technology. This research definitively belongs to
                  computer science, with keywords such as {\em object
                  orientation}, {\em regular expressions}, {\em string
                  matching\/} and {\em shape parameterization}.

                  A look at related fields, such as computer-aided
                  design, shows that there still remains plenty of
                  mathematical research to be done in digital
                  typography.  Mathematics is already used in CAD to
                  express aesthetic criteria, both at the local
                  (individual curves/surfaces) and the global level,
                  for ensuring overall appearance and design
                  consistency.

                  B{\'e}zier cubic and the general conic forms (which
                  include the distinctive parabolic format).  Though
                  there are good reasons for employing just the

                  cubics.

                  In order to improve the efficiency with which these
                  PostScript fonts can be rendered, the equation of
                  the B{\'e}zier cubic is here reduced to the
                  non-parametric form required to exploit an efficient
                  cubic tracking algorithm first presented in 1968.
                  Although successful in most cases, the occasional

                  as they are to letterforms.  The results of research
                  aimed at improving the perceptibility of letterforms
                  on screen are used to develop a set of modifications
                  that can be applied to symbols that have been
                  scanned from an original design on paper.  These
                  modifications are implemented in two stages:
                  rule-based modifications, followed by individual
                  pixel editing.  The effectiveness of these
                  modifications in improving the discriminability of

                  serifs. Authors contend that readers prefer roman
                  above sans serif, that it is read faster, and that
                  the comprehension rate is possibly higher when text
                  is set in a roman typeface.

                  The absence of satisfactory empirical data to prove
                  these assumptions, and the importance of legibility
                  in academic reading material, motivated this
                  study. The aim of the study was to determine the
                  comparative legibility of sans serif and roman
                  typefaces.

                  Four hundred and fifty primary school subjects from
                  nine different schools were used in a control group
                  pre-test, post-test research design where four
                  different experiments were completed.

                  Romans and sans serifs were found to be equally
                  legible, as no significant statistical difference
                  was found between the reading speed, scanning speed,
                  accuracy and comprehension at the 0.05 level.

                  These results are in contrast to the assumption that
                  romans are more legible than sans serifs. They can
                  be interpreted as promising for graphic designers
                  and typographers, as it appears that legibility will
                  not necessarily be sacrificed when certain reading

                  rigid tree structure of document components, help
                  users organize documents and make layouts.  Our
                  document model comprises the underlying structure
                  and the surface: the underlying structure is a
                  network structure; and the surface is an interface
                  providing a view of the underlying structure.  The
                  key features of our document model are: (1) the
                  surface defines tree structures as marked parts of
                  the underlying structure, and maintains consistency
                  between the network and tree structures; (2) the

                  network and marks the trails to define tree
                  structures; and (3) the defined tree structures work

                  recognize the structure of untagged electronic
                  documents which contain sub--documents with similar
                  format. For these kinds of documents manual
                  structure recognition is a highly repetitive
                  task. On the other hand, the specification of
                  recognition grammars requires significant
                  intellectual effort. Our approach uses manually
                  structured examples to incrementally generate
                  recognition grammars by means of techniques for
                  learning by example.  Users can structure example
                  portions of a document by inserting mark--ups. {\em
                  MarkItUp!\/} then abstracts and unifies the structure
                  of the examples. On this basis it tries to structure
                  another example with similar format. Users can
                  correct or accept the produced structure. With every
                  accepted example thereby a grammar is acquired and
                  gradually refined, which can be used to successfully
                  structure the other portions of the document.",

                  efficiency of a document structure analysis system,
                  which intends to analyse the complete logical
                  structure of a document. The usage of fuzzy logic
                  improves the system robustness; however, the problem
                  of system efficiency was revealed to be critical.

                  Different techniques have been studied to overcome
                  this problem. Dynamic programming, heuristics, and
                  dynamic threshold are used for parsing, which
                  achieves a linear complexity. A new concept of key
                  step, based on the principle of sub-goals, is
                  incorporated with a multi-pass and mixed top-down
                  analysis strategy, which avoids the combinatorial
                  explosion of the number of search paths. Finally,
                  the paper shows that the error-tolerating parser
                  based on an analysis graph seems more realistic and
                  efficient than an error-correcting parser.",
